**DocuChat: Conversational PDF Analyzer for Job Screening using LangChain and GROQ**

We built a Conversational RAG-based system using LangChain and GROQ that allows recruiters to upload Job Descriptions and Resumes in PDF format. The system extracts, stores, and indexes content using FAISS and MySQL, then enables natural language interaction to ask questions about the documents. It helps recruiters quickly analyze and compare candidate resumes with job descriptions by chatting with the uploaded PDFs in real-time, enhancing the speed and accuracy of the hiring process.
